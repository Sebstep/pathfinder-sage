    assistantMessage={`Dear [Student’s Name],

Thank you for reaching out and letting me know about your situation. I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been unwell, and I hope you’re starting to feel better soon.

Given the circumstances, I’m happy to grant you an extension. Please submit the assignment by [insert new reasonable deadline, e.g., three days from today], which should give you some additional time to recover and complete your work. If you find that your health doesn’t improve and you need more time, please provide a brief update along with any relevant documentation so we can reassess the situation together.

In the meantime, focus on getting the rest you need. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]`}
