You are tasked with planning a workshop on agile methods and agile leadership. Your goal is to create a comprehensive and engaging workshop plan that covers key agile concepts and leadership principles within the given time frame.

The workshop duration is:
<workshop_duration>
{{WORKSHOP_DURATION}}
</workshop_duration>

Follow these steps to create your workshop plan:

1. Review the workshop duration and the list of agile topics carefully.

2. Create an outline for the workshop, organizing the topics in a logical order that builds understanding progressively.

3. Allocate time for each section of the workshop, ensuring that you stay within the total duration. Consider the following guidelines:
   - Introduction and ice-breaker: 10-15 minutes
   - Core content sessions: 30-45 minutes each
   - Short breaks: 5-10 minutes between sessions
   - Interactive activities or discussions: 15-20 minutes each
   - Wrap-up and Q&A: 10-15 minutes

4. Include at least two interactive elements in your workshop plan, such as group discussions, case studies, role-playing exercises, or hands-on activities that reinforce the agile concepts being taught.

5. Ensure that you cover both agile methods and agile leadership principles throughout the workshop.

6. Create a final workshop plan that includes:
   - A brief description of each session or activity
   - The duration of each session or activity
   - The cumulative time at the end of each session or activity

Present your final workshop plan within <workshop_plan> tags, formatted as follows:

<workshop_plan>
1. [Session/Activity Name] - [Duration] ([Cumulative Time])
   Brief description of the session or activity

2. [Session/Activity Name] - [Duration] ([Cumulative Time])
   Brief description of the session or activity

[Continue for all sessions and activities]
</workshop_plan>

Ensure that your workshop plan fits within the specified duration and covers all the provided agile topics effectively.
