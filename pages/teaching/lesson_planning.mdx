# Crafting Lecture Notes and Lesson Plans

**How to prompt**: Tell the model about the topic, the duration of the class, and any teaching strategies you want to include. If you want to use particular pedagogical approaches (like case-based learning, discussions, problem-based learning, or other specific theories and practices), include those in your prompt.

1.	**Prime with pedagogy (optional)**: If you want the lesson plan to incorporate research-based teaching methods (such as retrieval practice, analogies, or active learning), you can prime the model first. For example, one approach is: “`Explain why retrieval practice, elaboration, analogies, and active learning are useful for learning.`” This ensures the AI is aware of these concepts in the conversation (it will summarize them for you). By [giving the model time to think](/prompting/chain-of-thought-prompting), this background step can lead to a lesson plan that naturally uses these techniques.
2.	**Request the lesson plan**: Now, ask for the plan.
Example Prompt: “`Act as an expert business education instructor. Design a 90-minute lesson plan for a class on organizational behavior management in a professional context using problem-based learning. Include: a brief introduction, 2-3 main activities or discussions (using active learning), and a conclusion. Ensure you incorporate retrieval practice where suitable.`”.
The AI should produce a structured lesson plan with timings (e.g., 10 minutes introduction, 20 minutes activity X, etc.) and describe each activity.
3.	**Refine details**: Review the suggested plan. Maybe it included a discussion but you prefer a small group exercise, or you want to add an example case. You can prompt for changes: “`Replace the think-pair-share activity with a case study example about a dog’s behavior issue, and include guided questions.`” If any content seems off (e.g., an explanation that isn’t quite right), ask for clarification or correction: “`Provide more detail on how to conduct the demonstration mentioned in step 2.`”
4.	Extract lecture notes or materials: Once the structure is good, you can also use AI to flesh out content for the lecture. For instance: “`Draft a half-page of lecture notes explaining the concept of operant conditioning in animal behavior, to be used in the above lesson.`” The model will generate explanatory text that you might use directly or edit. Another example: “`Give me the key points to highlight when discussing ethical considerations in animal behavior management.`” Use these outputs to enrich your own lecture preparation.
