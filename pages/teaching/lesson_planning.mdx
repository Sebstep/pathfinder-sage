# Crafting Lecture Notes and Lesson Plans

Integrating AI into your lesson planning process can enhance your teaching preparation; saving time, improving clarity, and allowing for greater pedagogical precision. AI tools are especially helpful for designing structured, engaging lesson plans and detailed lecture notes tailored to your teaching goals.

This guide outlines a systematic approach to using AI for lesson planning, focusing on evidence-based teaching strategies, efficient content generation, and adaptable formats.

## How to Prompt

<Callout type="info">Tell the model about the subject and topic, your audience, the duration of the class, and any pedagogical approaches, teaching strategies, or specific activities you want to include.</Callout>

<Steps>

### Begin with Pedagogical Grounding (Optional, but Recommended)

Before asking AI to create a lesson plan, consider first “priming” it with the teaching methods you’d like it to incorporate. This step isn’t mandatory, but it significantly improves the pedagogical depth of the AI-generated output. 

For instance, if you want to use science-backed strategies like active learning, problem-based learning, retrieval practice, elaboration, or analogies, you can begin the conversation by asking for a summary of these approaches. By [giving the model time to think](/prompting/chain-of-thought-prompting), this background step helps the AI understand what principles to embed in your lesson design. 

**Example Prompt**:
> Explain why **retrieval practice, elaboration, analogies, and active learning** are useful for learning.

### Generate a Structured Lesson Plan

Once primed (or even if you skip the priming step), your next step is to request a full lesson plan. Provide the following key details to ensure a well-tailored output:

- The subject and specific topic (e.g., organizational behavior management)
- The duration of the class (e.g., 90 minutes)
- Activities you want included (e.g., small group work, case study analysis, simulations)
- Cognitive goals or learning outcomes (e.g., critical thinking, application, synthesis)

Finally [Provide examples to guide the output](/prompting/give_examples/). A good lesson plan should include:

- A brief introduction or framing of the topic
- 2–3 main activities or teaching blocks, with time estimates
- Embedded use of retrieval practice, group discussion, or real-world application
- A conclusion or reflection activity to consolidate learning

The result should be a structured yet adaptable plan that you can immediately use or modify further.

**Example Prompt**:

> You are an experienced university educator specializing in **[your subject area]**. Design a **90-minute** lesson plan for a class on **[insert specific topic]** using **[insert pedagogy, e.g., problem-based learning, active learning]**. The plan should include: a brief introduction, 2–3 main activities or discussions, and a concluding segment to consolidate learning. Use evidence-based strategies such as retrieval practice, elaboration, and analogies where appropriate. Describe the purpose and method for each activity, and provide suggested timings for each section.

### Customize and Refine

The first draft may not be a perfect fit for your context, but that’s the strength of using AI: it’s highly responsive to revision.

You can request adjustments such as:

- Swapping a discussion activity for a case study
- Adding formative assessment checkpoints or quizzes
- Including guided questions for group work or Socratic dialogue
- Introducing a specific example or demonstration relevant to your discipline

This refinement stage ensures your lesson plan reflects your teaching style, student needs, and subject-specific nuances.

**Example Prompt**:
> Replace the discussion in **activity 2** with a **case study** involving **[describe scenario]**, and include guided questions for students.

### Generate Supporting Materials and Lecture Notes

Once the structure is set, AI can help flesh out the content you’ll deliver. Use it to:

- Draft lecture notes or explanations for key concepts (e.g., “Explain the difference between classical and operant conditioning”)
- Generate key talking points, diagrams, or analogies
- Provide short readings or case summaries
- Create comprehension or reflection questions
- Design student handouts or slides

**Example Prompt**:
> Now, provide a half-page lecture note on **[insert concept]**, to support the first activity.
