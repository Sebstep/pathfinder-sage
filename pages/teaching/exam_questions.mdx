Designing exams and quizzes can be time-consuming. AI can help by generating pools of questions or even full quizzes based on the topics you specify. For example, you might prompt, ‚ÄúCreate 5 multiple-choice questions and answers to test understanding of [Topic X],‚Äù or ‚ÄúPropose two essay questions that require critical thinking about [Topic Y].‚Äù Teachers have found that AI tools can draft or modify question sets for assessments, which they can then edit and approve. The more detail you give the AI about the learning objectives or difficulty level, the better it can tailor the questions ‚Äì for instance, indicating that you want application-level questions rather than factual recall. AI can even generate a rubric or scoring guide if you ask for it. Again, treat these outputs as drafts: review each suggested question for accuracy and clarity, and ensure the difficulty is appropriate for your students. By iterating with the AI (e.g., ‚Äúmake the previous question harder‚Äù or ‚Äúprovide the answer key‚Äù), you can quickly develop a well-rounded set of assessments.
