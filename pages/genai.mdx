# Basics of (Generative) AI

To use AI effectively in education, you don’t need to become an expert in the technical details. However, having a basic understanding of how AI works can help you make informed decisions, recognize its potential, and be mindful of its limitations. This knowledge empowers us to identify when AI can truly add value—and when it might not be the right tool for the job.

In this chapter, we’ll provide a focused overview of artificial intelligence, with a special emphasis on generative AI. We’ll also explore the key conditions that make for a viable, responsible AI use case in educational settings.
