# Introduction to (Generative) Artificial Intelligence

At its core, <mark>Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that learn from data</mark>. This learning is then assembled into a model. For instance, in weather data analysis, if clouds consistently form before it rains, the model can infer that cloud formation may indicate impending rain.

Generative AI is a fascinating branch of AI that focuses on creating new content. Unlike traditional AI systems designed for specific tasks like classification or prediction, <mark>generative AI produces original and diverse outputs that resemble human-created content</mark>. This includes generating text, images, and audio. AI models based on text are called Large Language Models (LLMs). They contain vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, an LLM can write a poem, answer questions, or even simulate a conversation.

  Imagine AI as a new intern at your company: highly motivated and capable, but
  needing clear and detailed instructions to perform well.
</mark> The ability to write clear instructions, known as prompts, is a powerful
and essential skill. A prompt is typically a text command, like “Tell me a joke.”
Writing effective prompts is crucial for getting the best results from AI.{" "}

Generative AI can automate a wide range of creative tasks, saving you time and effort. Here are some practical applications:

- **Writing emails and reports**: Automate routine correspondence and documentation.
- **Generating course materials**: Create educational content and resources.
- **Explaining and rewriting content**: Simplify complex information and adapt it for different audiences.
- **Providing individual feedback**: Offer personalized feedback and suggestions.

While AI is incredibly useful, it is not perfect. However, it can provide a solid starting point, often delivering an 80% solution in a fraction of the time it would take you to do it manually. This efficiency allows you to focus on the remaining 20% that really matters, adding your personal touch and expertise to finalize the task.

Artificial Intelligence, and specifically generative AI, is transforming the way we work and create. By understanding the basics of AI, learning how to craft effective prompts, and recognizing the applications and limitations of these technologies, you can harness their power to enhance productivity and innovation in your field. <mark>Embrace this new tool, and you’ll find yourself with more time to focus on what truly matters.</mark>

**Happy experimenting with AI!**
