# Crafting Effective Prompts

## Basic Principles

- **Garbage in, garbage out**: Unclear context or difficult to understand prompts reduce the quality of the answer.

- **Be clear and precise**: All necessary information and context for the desired answer should be included.

- **Use correct grammar and spelling**: Correct grammar helps to accurately interpret the request.

- **Keep prompts short**: Avoid superfluous information to focus on the essentials and relevant keywords.
  One topic per conversation: Frequent changes of topic lead more easily to incorrect or irrelevant answers.
