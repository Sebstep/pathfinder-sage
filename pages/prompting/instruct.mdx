# Instruct the Model Throughout the Prompt

When writing instructions, provide adequate context before describing the task you want the model to perform.

```md copy
Read the following excerpt from an essay:

“Despite the popular belief, there's no solid evidence supporting the idea that video games lead to violent behavior.
Research on the topic is often contradictory and inconclusive. Some studies found a correlation, but correlation doesn't imply causation.
So, it's premature to blame video games for violence in society.”

Provide feedback on this excerpt based on the following criteria: grammar, clarity, coherence, argument quality, and use of evidence.
Provide a score from 1-10 for each attribute, along with reasoning for your score.
```

Note the following points from the example above:

- **Instruct throughout the entire prompt**, e.g., by writing `Read the following excerpt...` instead of `This is an excerpt...`
- **Clearly specify the requirements**, e.g., by providing `...the following criteria: grammar, `
- **Clearly specify the desired output format**, e.g., by asking the model to `Provide a score from 1-10 for each attribute, along with reasoning for your score.`
