# Give the Model Time to Think

In chain-of-thought prompting, you <mark>encourage the AI to "show its work" as it arrives at a conclusion</mark>. Rather than jumping straight to an answer, the model follows a series of logical steps or considerations, as if it‚Äôs walking you through its thought process.

Chain-of-thought prompting results in <mark>responses that are more thorough, logical, and coherent</mark>. This method is particularly useful for complex tasks, like solving multi-step problems or analyzing nuanced topics, where a structured approach is essential.

## Benefits of Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- **Enhanced Clarity**: Breaking down complex questions into smaller steps allows the model to consider each part carefully, reducing the chance of misunderstanding or glossing over details.
- **Improved Accuracy**: With a step-by-step approach, the AI can "double-check" each stage, which often results in more reliable outcomes for calculations or logic-heavy tasks.
- **Transparency**: Following the model‚Äôs reasoning can be as valuable as the final answer. Chain-of-thought responses make the process visible and understandable to reduce [hallucinations](/genai/limitations#hallucinations).

## How to Create a Chain-of-Thought Prompt?

1. **Ask for Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Start by explicitly requesting that the model explain its thinking, e.g., `Walk through each step` or `Explain your reasoning step-by-step.`
2. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: When dealing with multi-layered problems, specify individual components the model should address, like analyzing cause and effect, listing pros and cons, or calculating intermediate values.
3. **Encourage Reflective Thinking**: If appropriate, ask the model to evaluate each stage before moving to the next, encouraging it to consider multiple perspectives or possibilities.

**Example with Chain-of-Thought prompt**

<div class="chat-container">
    <div class="message user">
        <div class="message-avatar">üôã</div>
        <div class="message-bubble">How many apples does Sarah have left if she starts with 12 apples and gives 7 to her friend? Explain your reasoning step-by-step.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="message assistant">
        <div class="message-avatar">ü§ñ</div>
        <div class="message-bubble">
            To determine how many apples Sarah has left, we follow these steps:
            1. **Start with the total number of apples Sarah has initially**: Sarah starts with 12 apples.
            2. **Subtract the number of apples Sarah gives away to her friend**: Sarah gives 7 apples to her friend. To find out how many apples remain, subtract 7 from 12.
            3. **State the result**: After giving away 7 apples, Sarah has 5 apples left.

            **Final Answer: Sarah has 5 apples left.**
