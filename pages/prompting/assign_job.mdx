# Assign the model a job

## Introduction to Role Prompting

Imagine going to the doctor with a mysterious ache, but instead of giving details, you just say, “Doc, something feels wrong.” The doctor, scratching their head, tries guessing: “Stomachache? Headache? Heartbreak?” Now you’re both stuck in the guessing game, wasting time and patience, as the doctor fumbles through every ailment known to medical science.

In role prompting, you assign the model a defined role or profession, such as “market researcher,” “personal coach,” or “business strategist.” This role acts as a framework, guiding the AI’s tone, language, and depth of response. Instead of a generic answer, <mark>the model adapts its output to align with the expectations and responsibilities associated with the assigned job</mark>.

## Benefits of Role Prompting

1. **Focus and Expertise**: By simulating a role, the model draws on relevant knowledge areas, which can lead to more in-depth and specialized responses.
2. **Contextual Language**: Role prompting helps shape the language and tone of the output, making it suitable for specific audiences (e.g., formal for a “legal advisor” vs. friendly for a “personal assistant”).
3. **Creativity and Structure**: For complex or creative tasks, role prompting provides structure. For instance, when acting as a “storyteller,” the model knows to follow narrative structures rather than a factual approach.

By giving the AI a clear job and goal (just like you’d tell the doctor what’s bugging you!), you avoid that dreaded wild-goose chase of vague answers. So next time you’re crafting a prompt, don’t be the patient who only mutters, “It hurts.” Give specifics, give roles, and save everyone some valuable guesswork!
