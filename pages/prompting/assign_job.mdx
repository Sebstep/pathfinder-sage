# Assign the model a job

## Introduction to Role Prompting

Imagine going to the doctor with a mysterious ache, but instead of giving details, you just say, "Doc, something feels wrong." The doctor, scratching their head, tries guessing: "Stomachache? Headache? Heartbreak?" Frustration builds as both of you stumble through a guessing game, wasting time and missing the mark.

In role prompting, <mark>you assign the model a defined role or profession</mark>, such as "teaching assistant," "market researcher," or "business strategist." This role acts as a framework, guiding the AIâ€™s tone, language, and depth of response. Instead of a generic answer, <mark>the model aligns its output with the expectations and responsibilities of the assigned role</mark>.[^Kong2023Better]

## Benefits of Role Prompting

1. **Focus and Expertise**: Assigning a role encourages the model to draw on relevant knowledge and expertise. This approach yields more nuanced and specialized responses.
2. **Contextual Language**: Role prompts shape the tone and language of responses to fit the audience. For example, a "legal advisor" role ensures formal, precise language, while a "personal assistant" role prioritizes a friendly, conversational tone.
3. **Creativity and Structure**: For tasks requiring creativity or complex outputs, role prompting adds structure. A model acting as a "storyteller," for instance, will follow narrative conventions rather than providing purely factual content.

By giving the AI a clear role and objective (much like telling the doctor exactly where it hurts), you eliminate guesswork, streamline interactions, and enhance the quality of AI-generated responses.
