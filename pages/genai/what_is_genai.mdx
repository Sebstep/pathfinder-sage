# Introduction to (Generative) Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

At its core, <mark>Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that learn from data</mark> to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This learning process results in the creation of a "model"—a representation of patterns in the data. For example, in weather analysis, if clouds consistently form before it rains, the model can infer that cloud formation may indicate impending rain.

## What is generative AI?

Generative AI is a fascinating branch of AI that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, music, or even videos. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily handles specific tasks like classifying or predicting outcomes, <mark>generative AI produces outputs that resemble human-created content</mark>. 

One key type of generative AI is Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on vast amounts of text data. These models can perform a wide range of tasks, such as writing poems, answering questions, or simulating conversations, by generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

<mark>Think of generative AI as a highly capable but inexperienced assistant: eager to help but dependent on clear instructions to deliver optimal results.</mark> This highlights the importance of learning how to craft effective prompts—text commands or questions that guide the AI. A prompt is typically a text command, like “Tell me a joke.” [Writing effective prompts](/prompting) is crucial for getting the best results from AI.

## How can generative AI be used?

Generative AI is a versatile tool that can automate creative and repetitive tasks, saving time and boosting productivity. Here are some practical applications:

- **Writing emails and reports**: Streamline routine communication and documentation.
- **Creating educational materials**: Develop course content, quizzes, and resources.
- **Simplifying complex concepts**: Reframe or adapt information for different audiences.
- **Providing personalized feedback**: Tailor suggestions and evaluations to individual needs.

While generative AI is powerful, it isn’t perfect. Often, it provides an 80% solution, giving you a strong foundation to build upon. By freeing up your time to focus on refining and customizing the remaining 20% that really matter, adding your personal touch and expertise to finalize the task.

Artificial Intelligence, and generative AI in particular, is transforming how we work and create. By understanding the basics of AI, learning how to craft effective prompts, and recognizing the capabilities and limitations of these technologies, you can unlock new opportunities for innovation and efficiency in your field.
