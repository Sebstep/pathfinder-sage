# When can language models be used?

If you want to delegate a task to an LLM, answer the following 4 questions.

<Steps>
## What happens if the output is wrong?
 
If the use case requires absolute accuracy, as in diagnostics, an LLM may not be the safest choice.

{/* TODO: expand upon algorithmic(-augmented) decision-making */}

## How will you check the accuracy of the answer?

The AI is your assistant. <mark>Only use an LLM for tasks that you could solve yourself given enough time.</mark>

## What data are you entering?

For sensitive data (e.g. personal information or source code), you may need to obtain the necessary consent.

Consider that **everything you put into a prompt will be sent to the operator of the language model**. Avoid putting personally identifiable or confidential information into your prompts. As a rule of thumb, we recommend that you <mark>put nothing into a prompt that you would not post publicly on your personal social media</mark>.

One way to ensure full privacy is to run a model locally on your own computer. However, this may require basic programming skills and, for the best performing models, powerful hardware.

{/* TODO: Don't input students personal data. */}

## Do you require ownership of the answer?

If the output is to be used commercially (e.g. music, literature), inadvertent infringements of existing copyrights are possible. 

In general, users can claim ownership of the answers as long as the terms of use and applicable laws are complied with. However, this is a field of ongoing legal debate.

- Non-unique responses cannot be claimed as they could also be generated for other users.
- When an output is provided directly to users (i.e., without a human in the loop), it must be clear to users that the answers do not originate from a human being.
- Language models must not be used for legal infringements (e.g., copyright infringements). If content is similar to copyrighted material, this could lead to claims. For example: If we ask a language model to write a song in the style of an artist, it could be legally unclear who owns the result - the user, the artist or the model developer.
